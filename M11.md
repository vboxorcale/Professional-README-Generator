## Code Source

* The source code for this project can be found in the ./index.js file in the PROFESSIONAL-README-GENERATOR folder

* This is a Node.js script that prompts the user with questions about their project and generates a README file based on their answers.

* The script uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with questions and then uses the generateMarkdown function, which is defined in a separate file (./utils/generateMarkdown.js), to generate the Markdown content for the README. Finally, the writeToFile function writes the generated Markdown to a file named README.md.

* Here's a brief overview of what each part of the script does:

Import necessary modules: fs, path, inquirer, and generateMarkdown.
Define an array of questions to prompt the user with using inquirer.
Define a function writeToFile that writes the generated Markdown to a file.
Define a function init that prompts the user with questions, generates the Markdown using generateMarkdown, and writes the result to a file using writeToFile.
Call init to start the program.

## Generate Markdown

The code is located in ./utils/generateMarkdown.js in the PROFESSIONAL-README-GENERATOR folder


This is the generateMarkdown function that generates the Markdown content for the README file based on the user's responses to the prompts. Here's an overview of what each part of the function does:

Define a function renderLicenseBadge that generates a license badge based on the user's selected license. If the license is "None", it returns an empty string.
Define a function renderLicenseLink that generates a license link based on the user's selected license. If the license is "None", it returns an empty string.
Define the main generateMarkdown function that takes in the user's responses as data and uses template literals to generate the Markdown content.
Use the renderLicenseBadge and renderLicenseLink functions to dynamically generate the license badge and license link sections of the README based on the user's selected license.
Return the generated Markdown content as a string.
Finally, export the generateMarkdown function so that it can be used in other files.
